⚠️ **Beta Release — Use at Your Own Risk**

Still in active development. **Create a Windows restore point before using.**

### What's new in v0.3.0

**Full-Screen Activation Overlay**

- When you activate or deactivate a workspace, a full-screen overlay now covers the app showing exactly what's happening
- Circular progress ring fills as steps complete, with the workspace emoji in the center and percentage below
- Every individual step is listed live: "Closing Slack", "Setting wallpaper", "Opening Steam" — each with its own status (pending → processing → done/skipped/failed)
- The overlay blocks all interaction until activation finishes — no more accidental clicks mid-switch
- On success, the overlay auto-fades after 1.5 seconds. If items were skipped, it holds for 3 seconds with a "Check logs" note. If most steps failed, a Dismiss button appears

**Redesigned Workspace Form**

- New three-section layout: Identity (name + emoji), What Happens (apps, folders, URLs), System & Vibes (audio, wallpaper, sound, playlist)
- Sticky header and footer that stay visible while scrolling — Cancel and Save are always accessible
- App tags are now color-coded: blue for "open" apps, coral for "close" apps
- "Browse for .exe" is now a subtle text link ("Can't find it? Browse for .exe") instead of a button
- Audio device and volume are side-by-side in the same row
- Wallpaper shows a small thumbnail preview when set

**Settings Auto-Save**

- All settings now save immediately when you change them — toggles save on flip, sliders on release, dropdowns on selection
- No more Save/Back buttons — the footer has been removed entirely
- Navigation back is handled by clicking workspaces in the sidebar

**Settings Page Additions**

- "Open logs folder" — coral text link in the Dry Run card that opens your logs folder in Windows Explorer
- "Check for updates" — card that opens the GitHub releases page in your default browser
- "Reset all workspaces" — danger zone button that deletes all workspaces and recreates the Default workspace from your current system state, with a confirmation dialog

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed audio device `succeeded` counter incrementing even when the device switch failed — caused misleading completion stats
- Fixed default workspace storing audio device name instead of device ID — caused "Don't change" to show incorrectly in the edit form
- Fixed activation overlay showing raw device ID instead of friendly device name for audio switching steps
- Fixed native select dropdown options appearing with white/light background — now renders with proper dark theme


### Removed in v0.3.0

- **Focus assist / Mute notifications** — the only available registry approach (NOC_GLOBAL_SETTING_TOASTS_ENABLED) only suppressed toast notifications, it did not toggle the real Windows Focus Assist. Removed to avoid misleading users. `system-settings.ts` deleted entirely.

### What's NOT included in v0.3.0

- Night light control (no safe Windows API exists)
- Monitor layout switching
- Bundled AudioDeviceCmdlets DLL (still requires one-time internet download)
- Workspace export/import
- Global hotkeys
- Auto-switch on device connect or time schedule

### Known issues

- Audio device switching requires first-launch internet connection to install AudioDeviceCmdlets PowerShell module (~2 seconds, one-time)
- Native select dropdown styling may vary across Windows versions — the dark option background is applied via CSS but Chromium's native rendering can override it in some configurations

### Upgrade from v0.2.0

Delete the contents of `%APPDATA%/scene-shiftr/workspaces/` before launching v0.3.0. The Default workspace will be recreated automatically on first launch with the correct audio device ID format.
