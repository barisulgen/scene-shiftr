# v0.3.0-beta — UI/UX Redesign

**Date:** 2026-03-02

## Highlights

Full visual overhaul of the workspace form, settings page, and activation experience. The app now has a polished activation overlay with step-by-step progress, a redesigned form layout with sticky header/footer, and auto-saving settings.

## New Features

### Full-Screen Activation Overlay
- Circular progress ring with gradient fill (coral → periwinkle) and workspace emoji
- Step-by-step live log showing every action (close app, set wallpaper, switch audio, etc.)
- Each step shows real-time status: pending → in-progress → success/skipped/failed
- Auto-scrolls to keep current step visible
- Completion states: auto-fade on success, "check logs" note on skips, dismiss button on failure
- Blocks all interaction until activation completes

### Settings Auto-Save
- All settings save immediately on change — toggles on flip, sliders on release, dropdowns on select
- Removed Save/Back buttons and footer entirely
- No more manual save step

### Settings Page Additions
- **Open logs folder** — coral text link in Dry Run card, opens `%APPDATA%/scene-shiftr/logs/` in Explorer
- **Check for updates** — card linking to GitHub releases page
- **Reset all workspaces** — danger zone with confirmation dialog, deletes all workspaces and recreates default from current system state

### Workspace Form Redesign
- Sticky header ("Edit/Create Workspace" + close button) and sticky footer (Cancel + Save)
- Three content groups: Identity, What Happens, System & Vibes
- Consistent input styling with subtle borders and coral focus states
- Blue tags for "open" apps, coral tags for "close" apps
- "Can't find it? Browse for .exe" text link instead of button

## Improvements

- Audio device and volume now side-by-side in the Sound section
- Audio device dropdown shows device name (not raw ID) in overlay progress
- Default workspace stores audio device ID correctly on first launch
- All select dropdowns now use solid dark background for readable native options
- Unified coral icon color across all settings cards
- Dynamic Dry Run card height (small when off, large when on with warning banner)
- Settings card heights compensated for 1.2x default zoom factor
- Removed duplicate "Transition Sound" label from form

## Bug Fixes

- Audio device `succeeded++` counter was incrementing even on failed switches
- Trailing blank line in display-controller.ts

## Removed

- Focus assist / mute notifications — registry approach only suppressed toasts, not real Focus Assist. Fully removed from types, code, tests, and UI.

## Technical

- 121 tests passing
- Zero TypeScript errors (both web and node configs)
- Structured IPC for activation overlay (overlay-start, overlay-step, overlay-complete)
- Unified logger service for both normal and dry run activation logging
