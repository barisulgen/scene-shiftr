## ⚠️ Alpha Release — Use at Your Own Risk

This is the first public release of Scene Shiftr. It works but has rough edges and has not been comprehensively tested. **Create a Windows restore point before using.**

### What works

- Create, edit, delete workspaces
- Open/close apps on workspace activation
- Audio device switching
- Volume control
- Wallpaper switching
- Folder and URL opening
- Transition sounds
- Spotify playlist auto-launch
- System tray integration
- Smart switching between workspaces (skip already-running apps)
- Safety whitelist (system-critical processes can never be killed)
- Dry run mode (preview what a workspace will do without executing)

### What's NOT included in v0.1.0

- Night light control (removed — registry manipulation corrupted Windows Settings, see #ISSUE_NUMBER)
- Focus assist toggle (not working)
- State snapshot and restore on deactivation
- Monitor layout switching

### Known issues

- App detector can cause infinite loop on some configurations — if CPU spikes on "Create Workspace", force quit and report
- Audio device switching requires first-launch internet connection to install AudioDeviceCmdlets PowerShell module (~2 seconds, one-time)
- Without state snapshot, deactivating a workspace does NOT revert your system settings — you'll need to manually change them back or activate another workspace

### Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11

### Installation

1. Download `Scene-Shiftr-Setup-0.1.0.exe` below
