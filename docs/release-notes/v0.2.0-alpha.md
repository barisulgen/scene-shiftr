⚠️ **Alpha Release — Use at Your Own Risk**

Still in active development. **Create a Windows restore point before using.**

### What's new in v0.2.0

**Default Workspace**

- New "Default" workspace that represents your baseline PC state
- Created automatically on first launch by capturing your current system settings
- Always pinned to the top of the sidebar with a 🏠 icon
- Can be edited (system settings only) but never deleted
- There is now always an active workspace — no more ambiguous "no workspace" state

**Deactivation**

- "Deactivate" button on the active workspace activates the Default workspace
- Deactivation closes any apps the previous workspace opened and applies your default system settings
- Replaces the old snapshot system entirely — simpler, more predictable, user-controlled

**Active Workspace Indicator**

- Sidebar now shows which workspace is active (coral dot)
- Tray menu shows active workspace and "Deactivate" option

**Activation Logging**

- Every activation and deactivation is now logged to `%APPDATA%/scene-shiftr/logs/activation/`
- One log file per day, timestamped entries for every step (success, failure, skipped)
- Dry run logs moved to `%APPDATA%/scene-shiftr/logs/dry-run/`
- Keeps last 20 daily log files per folder

**Resource Validation**

- Before activating, the app checks that all exe paths, wallpaper files, sound files, and folders exist
- Missing resources are skipped with a warning instead of crashing
- Audio device is verified to be available before switching

**Audio Device Verification**

- After switching audio devices, the app reads back the current device to confirm it actually changed
- Retries once on failure before logging an error

**Activation Queue**

- Clicking Activate while already activating is now ignored
- Button shows loading state during activation and is not clickable
- Prevents double-activation bugs

**Mid-Activation Protection**

- Close button and tray quit are disabled while activation is in progress
- Prevents half-applied system state if the app is closed during switching

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed infinite loop bug in app detector that caused thousands of Electron subprocesses to spawn when clicking "Create Workspace"

### Removed in v0.2.0

- **Focus assist / Mute notifications** — removed entirely. The only available registry approach only suppressed toast notifications, it did not toggle the real Windows Focus Assist. Removed to avoid misleading users.
- **State snapshot system** — replaced by the Default Workspace approach which is simpler and user-controlled

### What's NOT included in v0.2.0

- Night light control (no safe Windows API exists)
- Monitor layout switching
- Bundled AudioDeviceCmdlets DLL (still requires one-time internet download)
- UI redesign (coming in v0.3.0)

### Known issues

- Audio device switching requires first-launch internet connection to install AudioDeviceCmdlets PowerShell module (~2 seconds, one-time)

# IMPORTANT: Upgrade from v0.1.0

Delete the contents of `%APPDATA%/scene-shiftr/workspaces/` and `%APPDATA%/scene-shiftr/logs/` before launching v0.2.0. The Default workspace will be created automatically on first launch.
